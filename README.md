## Introduction

**(See Report.HTML for our full report)**

With crucial implications on public health and society development, the spatial-temporal variation of malaria infection and mortality rates in central Africa have received growing attention. Previous studies investigated the correspondence of malaria disease with climate conditions such as annual precipitation and daily maximum temperature. However, more detailed environmental conditions such as vegetation density, dominant tree species and surface water area may affect the habitats and propagation of mosquitos, the major vector of infection of malaria. In addition to these natural environmental conditions, control measures of human society also play crucial roles in observed malaria rates. Such control measures can be closely related to the quality of governance and demographics. In this study, we propose to investigate (1) the spatial-temporal patterns of reported malaria infection and mortality rates, and (2) their relationships with the aforementioned environmental and socio-political variables. Malaria rates will come from published dataset for counties in central Africa. Environmental variables are to be obtained from satellite remote sensing datasets and global land surface model outputs; and geo-coded socio-political variables will be gathered from multiple sources. Spatial Gaussian process models will be implemented and informative variables will be identified using the Bayesian Information Criteria.
